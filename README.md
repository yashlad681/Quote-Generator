# Thoughts
I had previously created a random quote generator back when I was doing the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Back when I made that random quote generator, I didn't use an API or anything like that. Instead, I had a 2 dimentional array. So I had an array that looked like
> let quoteArr = [['Hello World', '-Me'], ['Hi there', '-Someone']]

This way I had my own list of quotes that I wanted to include.

Unfortunately, I no longer seem to have the code for this quote generator. I do remember having a very complicated function to pick a quote. It included random number generators and for loops.

I think the way this generator was tought in the course was much better. It was a lot cleaner and really wasn't complicated at all. Back when I made the first one, I didn't know there was an API for quotes. I also barely had any idea how to work with APIs.
